Hi there! I'm Andrea. Iâ€™m an Aerospace Engineer turned programmer. Ever since I first learned how to program while taking a numerical analysis course, I have pursued programming as a passion, and hope as a career. I am currently doing a PhD on Fluid Mechanics at Sapienza University, with a main focus on multiphase turbulent flows. Check out [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/andreagalle) for more information on other projects.
